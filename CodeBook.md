The attached R script (run_analysis.R) performs the following to clean up the data:

* Merges the training and test sets to create one data set, namely train/X_train.txt with test/X_test.txt, train/subject_train.txt with test/subject_test.txt, and train/y_train.txt with test/y_test.txt

* Reads features.txt and extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 

* Reads activity_labels.txt and applies descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set:

        walking
        
        walkingupstairs
        
        walkingdownstairs
        
        sitting
        
        standing
        
        laying

* The script also appropriately labels the data set with descriptive names: all feature names (attributes) and activity names are converted to lower case, underscores and brackets () are removed. 
Then it merges the features data frame with activity labels data frame and subject IDs data frame. The result is saved as "merged_clean_data.txt"", a 10299x68 data frame:  the first column contains subject IDs, the second column activity names, and the last 66 columns are measurements. Subject IDs are integers between 1 and 30 inclusive. The names of the attributes are similar to the following:

        tbodyacc-mean-x 
        
        tbodyacc-mean-y 
        
        tbodyacc-mean-z 
        
        tbodyacc-std-x 
        
        tbodyacc-std-y 
        
        tbodyacc-std-z 
        
        tgravityacc-mean-x 
        
        tgravityacc-mean-y

* Finally, the script creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each measurement for each activity and each subject. 
The result is saved as "data_set_with_the_averages.txt"". The first column contains subject IDs, the second column contains activity names and then the averages for each of the 66 attributes are in columns 3...68. There are 30 subjects and 6 activities with averages.
